/*Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.*/

let markHeight = 1.69;
let markWeight = 78;
let johnHeight = 1.95;
let johnWeight = 95;

let markBmi = markWeight / (markHeight ** 2);
let johnBmi = johnWeight / (johnHeight ** 2);


if (markBmi > johnBmi) {
	console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBmi}) is higher than John's (${johnBmi})!`)
} else {
	console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBmi}) is higher than Mark's (${markBmi})!`)
}
